The primary objective of this project is to build and deploy a web application using core AWS cloud services. The deployment infrastructure leverages Amazon EC2 to serve as the virtual server environment and Amazon S3 for static file storage. The overarching goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with AWS services and strengthen practical knowledge in cloud-based application deployment.
